Writing a Simple Unit Test
Unit tests are a way to test small pieces of code, such as functions and methods.
This is useful because it allows you to find bugs early.
Unit tests make your testing strategies more efficient, since they are small and independent,
 and thus easy to maintain.

Writing Table-Driven Tests

When writing tests, you may find yourself repeating a lot of code in order to
cover all the cases required. Think about how you would go about covering the
many cases involved in the Fooer example. You could write one test function per case,
but this would lead to a lot of duplication. You could also call the tested function
several times in the same test function and validate the output each time, but if the
test fails, it can be difficult to identify the point of failure. Instead, you can use a
table-driven approach to help reduce repetition.
As the name suggests, this involves organizing a test case as a table that contains the
inputs and the desired outputs.

This comes with two benefits:
--Table tests reuse the same assertion logic, keeping your test DRY.
--Table tests make it easy to know what is covered by a test, as you can easily

	see what inputs have been selected. Additionally, each row can be given a unique
	 name to help identify whatâ€™s being tested and express the intent of the test.
